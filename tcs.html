You may be asked puzzles in this round.<br><br>
    
 <h3>Managerial Round:</h3>
  This round includes everything that was in the Technical round plus it will be under pressure and a lot of cross-checking. Doubts will be raised on your answers to check if you can handle stress or not. Students may or may not be sent to this round depending on the feedback of the previous round. If the feedback of the previous round was good you may expect to directly been sent to the HR round.

  <h3>HR Round</h3>
